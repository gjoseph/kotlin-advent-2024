# kotlin-advent-2024

This is my Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project, copied from [last year's](https://github.com/gjoseph/gjoseph/kotlin-advent-2023).

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
